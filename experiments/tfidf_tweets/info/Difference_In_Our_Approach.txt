-They have used a lot of vocabulary based feature extraction techniques that do not scale up as their vocabulary is small.

-We do pre-processing of text with the 7 filters, to support unstructured tweets.

-We use TF-IDF features that don't need any vocabulary instead of the unigrams and bigrams that they use, that might be nosiy.

-We have also filtered features if they exceeded the Max Document Frequency of 50%.

-We are using Chi2 test as a feature selection (in our case 3.5k features from 71k)

-They use Logistic regression from LIBLINEAR and not LinearSVM.
